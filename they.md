## {% include icons/member-add.svg size="38" %} <yeet>They/Them!?</yeet>

Hi, yes. I am a singular person, (not to be confused with people who use <a href="https://freyasspirit.com/plurality-playbook/" class="uno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">_plural_ they/them</a>) who uses they/them. This is because I don't feel male _or_ female, and it is just comfier for me to use they/them rather than other pronouns.

## <yeet>Neopronouns?</yeet>

Some non-binary folks use neopronouns, which are a more modern solution to not having truly non-binary pronouns. I personally dont really care if anyone uses neopronouns for me, but if you do, then use **xe/xem**. Here are some examples from <a href="http://pronoun.is/xe/xem" class="uno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pronoun.is</a>:

- **Xe** went to the park.

- I went with **xem**.

- **Xe** brought **xyr** frisbee.

- At least I think it was **xyrs**.

- **Xe** threw the frisbee to **xemself**.
