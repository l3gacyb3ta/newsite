I created a series of mobile-friendly and printable web-based guides to help college students find their way around the Philadelphia area on public transit. ðŸšˆðŸšŒðŸšŽðŸš‹

As part of my advisory role with SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority), I collaborated with the members of the Youth Advisory Council to update new rider resources distributed to schools in the area. The existing resources consisted of brochures that needed to be individually updated in Microsoft Publisher, and often contained outdated information.

Consulting with students new to the area and/or have never ridden public transit before in small focus groups, I turned these brochures into web-based guides that are digital-first. It put forward resources pertaining to the 3 most commonly asked questions by students:

- Where are the stops?
- How much does it cost? How to I pay?
- What does the train/bus take me?

[Web guide for Bryn Mawr College: ![webpage](https://cdn.glitch.com/2d246102-8341-4166-a220-b39d607c9218/transit-guides-header.png?1555779821247)](https://pixelyunicorn.github.io/septa-guides/brynmawr/)

At the bottom of each guide, there is a card layout that allows information to be kept up to date between guides. (This is especially important for fare changes or the rollout of new payment methods.)

You can even print these pages to generate brochures using your browser's built-in print command. Printed brochures are distributed at information desks and new student orientations at colleges throughout the Philadelphia area.

A [simple YAML file](https://github.com/pixelyunicorn/septa-guides/blob/master/pages/immaculata.md) provides the data for each of the guides. Information such as fares, maps, and walking directions are automatically generated (and kept up to date) based on what is provided in the YAML file.
